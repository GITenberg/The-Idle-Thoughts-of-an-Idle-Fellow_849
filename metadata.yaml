description: "Idle Thoughts of an Idle Fellow, published in 1886, is a collection\
  \ of humorous essays by Jerome K. Jerome. It was the author’s second published book\
  \ and it helped establish him as a leading English humorist. While widely considered\
  \ one of Jerome’s better works, and in spite of using the same style as Three Men\
  \ in a Boat, it was never as popular as the latter. A second \"Idle Thoughts\" book,\
  \ The Second Thoughts of An Idle Fellow, was published in 1898.\nThe essays had\
  \ previously appeared in Home Chimes, the same magazine that later serialised Jerome's\
  \ Three Men in a Boat.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
